    <p>The &lt;aside&gt; tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.</p>
    <p>The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.</p>
    <p><strong>tip:</strong> The &lt;aside&gt; content is often placed as a sidebar in a document.</p>
    <p><strong> Note:</strong> The &lt;aside&gt; element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the &lt;aside&gt; element (see example below).</p>
    <p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!</p>
