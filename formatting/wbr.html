    <p>The <wbr> (Word Break Opportunity) tag specifies where in a text it would be ok to add a line-break.</p>
    <p>This tag is similar to the <br> tag but <wbr> is for browsers to line-break if there is an opportunity.</p>
    <p>Note: When a word is too long, the browser might break it at the wrong place.</p>
    <p>The wbr element is not supported in Internet Explorer 11 (or earlier).</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
        <p>Try to shrink the browser window, to view how the very long word in the paragraph below will break:</p>

        <p>This is a veryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryveryvery<wbr>longwordthatwillbreakatspecific<wbr>placeswhenthebrowserwindowisresized.</p>
